### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Cordele Mincey III

I am a data analyst with goals of becoming proficient in machine learning. I currently teach kids javascript at Code Ninjas and love the feeling of getting them to understand it. Some IDE's I enjoy working out of is Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio and Eclipse. A lot of my projects were school based and just now being committed to my github but definitely check them out and I look forward to connecting with you.
